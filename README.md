This Blogging Section for Ofori's Website was developed using React, specifically using Vite for efficiency, and has three example blog posts displayed in the first three slots with the latter two being placeholder slots for future posts.  

The Feedback System for Ofori's Website was also developed in React, using Firebase Realtime Database to handle data synchronization and storage efficiently.
